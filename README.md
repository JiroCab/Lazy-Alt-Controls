# New-Controls
A mindustry mod that adds two new control modes: AI and joystick (the latter is mobile only cus you can't have two pointers on desktop).

This mod ***is multiplayer-compatible***, meaning you can use all its features (even the unfair ones) in the multiplayer.

# Enabling
To enable the controls: press the ðŸ”§ (wrench) button while in-game. You will see a panel with a status bar and a big red "DISABLED" label. Clicking on the label toggles the controls.

By default the manual control mode is enabled. You can switch to ai mode by disabling a toggle with a cross icon in the placement ui.

### Important notice
While the controls are enabled, you won't be able to perform some actions that are possible in vanilla mode (such as building). You can disable & enable the controls at any time so that shouldn't be a problem.

# Manual mode
Enabled by default. Consists of two thumbsticks (movement (left) and aiming / shooting (right)) and a control panel at the bottom part of screen in landscape and above right thumbstick in portrait mode that allows you to perform some actions such as to pick/drop payloads, command units, etc.

# Ai mode
Can be enabled by disabling a toggle in the placement ui (right bottom corner). Reveals an ai control panel under the status label. Consists of four modes:
* auto: performs one of three following based on situation
* attack: targets nearest units & buildings in a specified radius, keeps maximum possible distance
* mine: automatically mines specified items
* patrol: goes to the nearest spawn point / enemy core

Some of the actions can be configured in the left panel.
